### About this Project
Bycatch, the unintentional capture of species fishers don’t want, can’t sell, or can’t keep, can be a significant challenge in commercial fisheries. Beyond its environmental impact, bycatch creates economic inefficiencies and regulatory hurdles for the fishing industry. Bycatch issues became particularly pressing after the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill, which disrupted Gulf Coast ecosystems and fisheries.

To restore impacted fisheries, the Communications Networks and Mapping Tools to Reduce Bycatch Project was initiated by the Deepwater Horizon Open Ocean Trustees in 2019. Mote Marine Laboratory is collaborating with the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation (NFWF) and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), who manage this project, with the goal of exploring how real-time communication networks can help reduce bycatch. By enabling fishermen to share and act on spatial data in near real-time, bycatch hotspots can be identified and avoided by a fleet of participants. As part of this initiative, a Shiny for R application has been developed to prototype a streamlined data reporting and visualization tool that can benefit commercial and charter fishers in the Gulf of Mexico.
